    "Born in a hill village that treated old ruins as common landmarks, they spent most of their life repairing tools, copying maps, and guiding travelers through roads locals considered ordinary. They left after a winter landslide exposed sealed stonework under the village shrine, bringing practical skills, a few local contacts, and one question their elders refused to answer.",
    "In their former life, they died in a hospital stairwell during a citywide blackout after spending years as an overworked emergency technician. They woke in this world with most memories intact but no proof of who they had been, carrying modern habits of triage, suspicion of official silence, and a need to learn which rules of the new world can still kill them.",
    "Born on the edge of a company town, they were trained young to weigh ore, settle shift disputes, and keep peace between hungry workers and richer overseers. They arrived at the starting point after their home contract collapsed, with a known name among laborers, a practical distrust of nobles, and a short list of people who may blame them for surviving.",
    "They remember being born somewhere else entirely: a quiet apartment, a locked office job, and a fatal accident on a rain-slick road. This new body has its own calluses and local debts, so the player begins with two lives worth of instincts but only fragments of why this world's people already seem to expect something from them.",
