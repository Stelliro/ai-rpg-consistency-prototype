# AI RPG Consistency Prototype

Version `0.6.0`

AI RPG Consistency Prototype is a local-first browser RPG experiment. A local LLM narrates turns and proposes structured world changes, while SQLite remains the source of truth for the player, inventory, NPCs, events, summaries, and long-running continuity.

It is still pre-1.0 software, but it has enough systems in place to be useful as a playable prototype and a base for experimentation.

## Highlights

- FastAPI backend with a plain browser UI, no frontend build step.
- SQLite world state stored locally under `data/`.
- Local LLM support through llama.cpp-compatible and Ollama-compatible APIs.
- Character and world setup for identity, previous-life details, rules, abilities, economy, magic, tech, skills, progression, and narration style.
- Action-focused turn context so the model reads the relevant facts for movement, combat, ability use, conversation, trade, inventory, training, rest, and investigation.
- Equipment effects that fold equipped item stat modifiers and item-granted abilities into effective player stats/abilities only while equipped.
- Stable entity codes for NPCs, locations, items, and events, with clickable references in narration.
- Visual history, compact memory summaries, source-index search, World Bible view, rewind, regenerate, import, and export.
- Hidden backend-only GM events for off-screen pressure and delayed consequences.
- Local-only, LAN/phone, and trusted VPN/private-overlay launch modes.

## Requirements

- Windows is the primary supported launch target.
- Python 3.11+ is recommended.
- A local model server or GGUF model is needed for AI generation.
- The app can still open without a configured model, but generation will fall back or fail until model settings are configured.

Install Python dependencies manually when needed:

```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

Double-click:

```text
start_ai_rpg.bat
```

Choose one launch mode:

- `1` - This machine only, usually `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- `2` - Local network / phone on the same Wi-Fi or LAN
- `3` - VPN / virtual network for trusted overlays such as Tailscale, WireGuard, ZeroTier, or OpenVPN

You can also launch non-interactively:

```text
start_ai_rpg.bat local
start_ai_rpg.bat lan
start_ai_rpg.bat vpn 8088
```

The launcher starts the browser app and, when a valid GGUF path is configured, can start a managed llama.cpp server. Closing the launcher terminal stops managed processes.

## Model Setup

Set a GGUF model path before launching if you want the managed llama.cpp server to start automatically:

```powershell
$env:AI_RPG_GGUF_MODEL="D:\path\to\model.gguf"
```

Useful overrides:

```powershell
$env:AI_RPG_LLAMA_CPP_CONTEXT="8192"
$env:AI_RPG_LLAMA_CPP_GPU_LAYERS="-1"
$env:AI_RPG_LLAMA_CPP_FLASH_ATTN="True"
$env:AI_RPG_LLM_STARTUP_TIMEOUT="180"
$env:AI_RPG_MAX_RESPONSE_TOKENS="1500"
$env:AI_RPG_RESPONSE_HARD_CAP_TOKENS="2000"
$env:AI_RPG_TURN_DRAFT_TIMEOUT="900"
$env:AI_RPG_TURN_VERIFY_TIMEOUT="480"
```

To use an existing local server instead, configure model settings in the UI or set:

```powershell
$env:AI_RPG_MODEL_PROVIDER="llama_cpp"
$env:LLAMA_CPP_BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8080"
```

For Ollama-compatible use:

```powershell
$env:AI_RPG_MODEL_PROVIDER="ollama"
$env:OLLAMA_BASE_URL="http://localhost:11434"
$env:OLLAMA_MODEL="llama3.1"
```

## Playing From A Phone

Use LAN mode when your phone/tablet is on the same trusted Wi-Fi or wired LAN. The launcher prints a recommended phone URL such as `http://192.168.x.x:8000`.

Use VPN mode only on a trusted private overlay. The app UI binds to the selected network, but the managed llama.cpp server stays bound to loopback by default.

If a device times out:

- Use the exact URL printed by the launcher.
- Confirm both devices are on the same LAN or VPN overlay.
- Allow Python or Uvicorn through Windows Firewall for that network profile.

## Runtime Data

Runtime state lives in `data/` and is ignored by git:

- `data/world.db` - SQLite world database
- `data/history_summaries.jsonl` - compact turn summaries
- `data/source_index/` - generated searchable memory index

World export/import uses the `ai-rpg-world-v1` JSON format. Setup settings export/import uses `ai-rpg-setup-settings-v1` and does not include the active world database.

## Development Notes

- The model must return JSON; the backend applies changes conservatively.
- Health, XP, gold, level, inventory counts, and other sensitive values are clamped before persistence.
- Raw journal history is visible to the player, but the model receives structured state, source-index facts, summaries, and bounded hidden GM context instead of full prose history.
- New playthroughs start with no default player skills. Skills emerge through play, training, discovery, or explicit custom proficiency setup rules.
- Equipment-granted abilities are not permanent ability records. They appear in state and prompts only while the source item is equipped.
- The deterministic turn planner packet is versioned separately from the app release version.
