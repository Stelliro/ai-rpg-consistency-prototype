## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-13

> Public pre-1.0 release. This is a featureful local prototype with durable state, focused LLM context, LAN/VPN launch options, regeneration, hidden GM context, setup persistence, and equipment-derived capabilities.

### Added
- [DOCS] Added a strict non-commercial license reference allowing non-commercial forks and modified uploads - licensing
- [GPLAY] Added equipped-item stat modifiers and item-granted abilities that derive into player stats and abilities only while equipped - equipment effects
- [LLM] Added action-specific context segments and focused player capability slices for movement, combat, abilities, and other turn intents - turn generation
- [FE] Added high-visibility turn reward banners for applied XP and item gains - browser UI
- [BILD] Added a VPN/private-overlay launch mode with port selection and VPN URL detection - startup
- [GPLAY] Added current and previous-life age/sex fields to character creation - setup identity
- [BILD] Added local-only and local-network launch modes for phone access - startup
- [FE] Added responsive phone, landscape mobile, and small-monitor layout rules - browser UI
- [GM] Added backend-only hidden GM events for between-turn consequences and off-screen reactions - hidden world context
- [FE] Added paged, collapsed visual history with persisted expansion choices - browser UI
- [UI] Added full-page start splash with progress lines and animated opening narration reveal - setup flow
- [FE] Added compact scene plan readout for high-level model focus points after generated turns - browser UI
- [GPLAY] Added event lifecycle metadata for temporary, recurring, traveling, background, and persistent location events - world events
- [LLM] Added deterministic turn context planning to focus prompts by intent, working set, and verifier risk checks - turn generation
- [FE] Added setup settings save/load with comma-separated Custom Proficiencies guidance and normalization - setup UI
- [GPLAY] Added latest-response regeneration for opening, continue, and player turns - turn tools

### Changed
- [BE] Changed app version metadata to `V0.6.0` for the public pre-1.0 release - API surface
- [BILD] Changed launcher and model defaults to avoid machine-specific GGUF paths and rely on `AI_RPG_GGUF_MODEL` or UI model selection - startup
- [DOCS] Reworked README for public release clarity while keeping setup, model, LAN/VPN, data, and license notes concise - documentation
- [LLM] Split response cap and hard cap token settings with editable model controls and larger repair defaults - model settings
- [LLM] Changed turn prompts and source-index generation so raw journal history stays visual-only and model memory uses structured records - prompt context
- [FE] Changed opening narration reveal timing to stay visible longer after setup generation completes - setup flow
- [LLM] Changed turn prompts to request a 1-6 focus point scene plan and continuous prose narration - prompt contract
- [FE] Changed current turn rendering to join model narration chunks into one continuous prose flow - browser UI
- [BILD] Changed managed llama.cpp launcher logs to quiet temp files by default with `AI_RPG_LLM_LOG_MODE=console` opt-in - startup
- [GPLAY] Changed new playthrough setup to stop seeding default player skills and let skills emerge through play or explicit custom rules - setup system
- [DOCS] Made `.github` Copilot instructions project-specific and referenced instruction files in the codebase index - AI workflow

### Fixed
- [BE] Fixed setup 422 responses from null or invalid mobile form values by normalizing setup payloads before validation - setup API
- [BILD] Fixed local-network launcher URL selection to prefer Wi-Fi/Ethernet over VPN or virtual adapter addresses - startup
- [LLM] Fixed local llama.cpp turn fallbacks from slow drafts by raising phase-specific timeouts and logging prompt diagnostics - model adapter
- [LLM] Fixed malformed turn JSON repair using too small a repair token budget before fallback - model adapter
- [LLM] Fixed setup randomizer 503s by returning deterministic backend fallback fields when model setup JSON is invalid or unavailable - setup randomization
- [BILD] Fixed launcher startup race by waiting for llama.cpp readiness before opening the app - startup
- [BE] Fixed `/api/version` health checks by returning local app and planner version metadata - API surface
- [LLM] Fixed the turn planner packet version string to use `V0.1.0` - turn generation
- [LLM] Fixed deterministic fallback when turn JSON contains salvageable or verifier-omitted narration - turn generation
- [LLM] Fixed context-length fallback by raising the managed llama.cpp default context and adding compact turn retries - model adapter

### Removed
- [GM] Removed the visible GM tab while keeping hidden GM context backend-only - browser UI

<!--
  HOW TO USE THIS FILE
  ====================

  1. Every functional code change gets one line under [Unreleased].
  2. Prefix each entry with the responsible agent ID in brackets, such as [ARCH], [FE], [BE], [DATA], [LLM], [GPLAY], [GM], [BILD], [DOCS], or [TEST].
  3. Use the correct category:
       Added   - new feature, system, file, endpoint, screen
       Changed - modified behavior, API, schema, config
       Fixed   - bug fix, crash fix, logic correction
       Removed - deletion, deprecation cleanup
  4. Skip formatting-only churn. Include docs when they change contributor workflow or project operation.
  5. When releasing: rename [Unreleased] to the new version and release date, then add a fresh [Unreleased] above it.
